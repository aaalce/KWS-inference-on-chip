Hi! i have a KWS accelerator with the following Micro architecture and ISA. I have also included a copy of our python code for the KWS accelerator called inference0519. I would like to implement it on Caravel Harness, a SoC. The KWS accelerator will be in the user project area wrapper of Caravel Harness, interface with a RISC-V core via wishbone bus. According to these, can you write me a code in verilog for the CMVN Module? The CMVN is controlled by the FSM which i have attached the code too.

Claude:
Sure! Here's a Verilog code for the CMVN (Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization) module based on the provided KWS accelerator microarchitecture and ISA:
verilog

Copy code
module cmvn (
  input wire clk,
  input wire rst_n,
  input wire cmvn_en,
  input wire [31:0] input_data,
  input wire [31:0] cmvn_mean,
  input wire [31:0] cmvn_istd,
  output reg [31:0] output_data,
  output reg cmvn_done
);

  // Internal registers
  reg [31:0] mean_reg;
  reg [31:0] istd_reg;
  reg [31:0] input_reg;

  // CMVN calculation
  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      mean_reg <= 32'b0;
      istd_reg <= 32'b0;
      input_reg <= 32'b0;
      output_data <= 32'b0;
      cmvn_done <= 1'b0;
    end else if (cmvn_en) begin
      mean_reg <= cmvn_mean;
      istd_reg <= cmvn_istd;
      input_reg <= input_data;
      output_data <= (input_reg - mean_reg) * istd_reg;
      cmvn_done <= 1'b1;
    end else begin
      cmvn_done <= 1'b0;
    end
  end

endmodule
Explanation:
The CMVN module takes the following inputs:
clk: Clock signal
rst_n: Active-low reset signal
cmvn_en: Enable signal from the FSM controller to start CMVN calculation
input_data: Input data tensor from the Input Buffer
cmvn_mean: Mean value for CMVN normalization
cmvn_istd: Inverse standard deviation value for CMVN normalization
The module produces the following outputs:
output_data: Normalized output data tensor
cmvn_done: Done signal indicating the completion of CMVN calculation
The module uses internal registers to store the mean, inverse standard deviation, and input data.
When cmvn_en is asserted by the FSM controller, the module performs the following steps:
Stores the cmvn_mean, cmvn_istd, and input_data in the respective internal registers.
Calculates the normalized output data using the formula: (input_data - mean) * istd.
Asserts the cmvn_done signal to indicate the completion of CMVN calculation.
When cmvn_en is deasserted, the module sets cmvn_done to low.
The module is synchronized with the clock signal clk and can be reset using the active-low rst_n signal.
To integrate this CMVN module into the KWS accelerator:
Connect the cmvn_en signal from the FSM controller to the CMVN module.
Connect the input_data from the Input Buffer to the CMVN module.
Provide the cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd values from the Configuration and Status Registers (CSRs) to the CMVN module.
Connect the output_data from the CMVN module to the Linear module.
Use the cmvn_done signal to indicate the completion of CMVN calculation to the FSM controller.
Remember to ensure proper synchronization and handshaking between the CMVN module and other modules in the accelerator design.

cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd only need to be load once and the data doesnt change. I would like to make a register file for it and preload it , instead of asking the FSM to load it. I have attached my CMVNpara.txt, can you make me a register file and update the CMVN module design?

Claude:
Certainly! Here's an updated Verilog code for the CMVN module with a register file for storing the cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd values:

Explanation:
The cmvn_param_reg_file module is introduced to store the cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd values in register files.
The register files are initialized with the provided values from the CMVNpara.txt file.
The register files are accessed using the feature_idx input, which represents the index of the feature being processed.
The updated cmvn module instantiates the cmvn_param_reg_file module to access the cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd values.
The cmvn module now takes an additional input feature_idx to select the appropriate mean and inverse standard deviation values for the current feature.
The CMVN calculation is updated to use the indexed cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd values based on the feature_idx.
With these updates, the CMVN module no longer relies on the FSM to load the mean and inverse standard deviation values. Instead, the values are preloaded into the register files during initialization and accessed based on the feature_idx input.
To integrate this updated CMVN module into the KWS accelerator:
Instantiate the cmvn_param_reg_file module in the top-level module of the accelerator.
Connect the feature_idx input of the CMVN module to the appropriate control signal from the FSM or the module responsible for tracking the current feature index.
Follow the previously mentioned integration steps for the CMVN module.
By preloading the CMVN parameters into register files, you can avoid the overhead of loading them repeatedly from memory and improve the efficiency of the CMVN calculation.
