Hi, Can you write a python code for me that convert this .json file to .mem file please? I have attached the .txt version of the file

## Claude
Certainly! Here's a Python script that converts the JSON data from the provided text file to a .mem file:
python

Copy code
import json

def json_to_mem(json_data, output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        for layer in json_data['dilated_cnn_weight']:
            for row in layer:
                for value in row:
                    file.write(value + '\n')

/# Read the JSON data from the text file
with open('dilated_cnn_weight_hexa.txt', 'r') as file:
    json_data = json.load(file)

/# Convert JSON to .mem file
json_to_mem(json_data, 'dilated_cnn_weight.mem')
Here's how the script works:
We define a function called json_to_mem that takes the JSON data and the output file name as parameters.
Inside the function, we open the output file in write mode using a with statement.
We iterate over each layer in the 'dilated_cnn_weight' array of the JSON data.
For each layer, we iterate over each row.
For each row, we iterate over each value.
We write each value to the output file, followed by a newline character ('\n').
We read the JSON data from the text file ('dilated_cnn_weight_hexa.txt') using json.load().
We call the json_to_mem function, passing the JSON data and the desired output file name ('dilated_cnn_weight.mem').
Make sure that the 'dilated_cnn_weight_hexa.txt' file is in the same directory as the Python script, and then run the script. It will generate a file named 'dilated_cnn_weight.mem' in the same directory, containing the converted data.
Each value from the JSON data will be written on a separate line in the .mem file.
Let me know if you have any further questions!

Hi, it only converted the final 60 inputs I need it converted everything in the file

## Claude
Apologies for the confusion. I'll modify the script to convert all the data in the file. Here's the updated Python script:
python

Copy code
import json

def json_to_mem(json_data, output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        for weights in json_data['dilated_cnn_weight']:
            for layer in weights:
                for row in layer:
                    for value in row:
                        file.write(value + '\n')

/# Read the JSON data from the text file
with open('dilated_cnn_weight_hexa.txt', 'r') as file:
    file_content = file.read()
    json_data = json.loads('{' + file_content + '}')

/# Convert JSON to .mem file
json_to_mem(json_data, 'dilated_cnn_weight.mem')
Here's what has been updated in the script:
In the json_to_mem function, we now have an additional loop to iterate over each set of weights in the 'dilated_cnn_weight' array.
When reading the JSON data from the text file, we first read the entire content of the file using file.read().
Since the provided JSON data is incomplete (it doesn't have the opening and closing curly braces), we manually add them to the file content using '{' + file_content + '}'.
We then parse the modified JSON data using json.loads() to convert it into a Python dictionary.
The rest of the script remains the same, calling the json_to_mem function with the JSON data and the desired output file name.
Make sure that the 'dilated_cnn_weight_hexa.txt' file is in the same directory as the Python script, and then run the script. It will generate a file named 'dilated_cnn_weight.mem' in the same directory, containing all the converted data from the input file.
Each value from the JSON data will be written on a separate line in the .mem file.
Let me know if you have any further questions or if you encounter any issues!

json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)
The error occurs because the JSON data in the text file is not properly formatted. It seems that the property names are not enclosed in double quotes.
To fix this, you can modify the script to add double quotes around the property names. Here's the updated Python script:
python

Copy code
import json
import re

def json_to_mem(json_data, output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        for weights in json_data['dilated_cnn_weight']:
            for layer in weights:
                for row in layer:
                    for value in row:
                        file.write(value + '\n')

/# Read the JSON data from the text file
with open('dilated_cnn_weight_hexa.txt', 'r') as file:
    file_content = file.read()
    # Add double quotes around property names
    file_content = re.sub(r'(\w+):', r'"\1":', file_content)
    json_data = json.loads('{' + file_content + '}')

/# Convert JSON to .mem file
json_to_mem(json_data, 'dilated_cnn_weight.mem')
Here's what has been updated in the script:
We import the re module to use regular expressions for modifying the JSON data.
After reading the file content, we use re.sub() to add double quotes around the property names. The regular expression r'(\w+):' matches any word characters followed by a colon, and r'"\1":' replaces it with the matched word enclosed in double quotes.
We then parse the modified JSON data using json.loads() as before.
The rest of the script remains the same.
Run the updated script, and it should resolve the JSONDecodeError and generate the 'dilated_cnn_weight.mem' file with all the converted data.
Let me know if you have any further questions or if you encounter any other issues!

It has this error code again. Can you ask it to ignore the names and only obtain the values, to store it to .mem?

## Claude
Certainly! If you only need to extract the values and store them in the .mem file, you can modify the script to handle the JSON data as a string and use regular expressions to extract the values. Here's the updated Python script:
python

Copy code
import re

def extract_values(file_content, output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        values = re.findall(r'"([0-9a-fA-F]+)"', file_content)
        for value in values:
            file.write(value + '\n')

/# Read the content from the text file
with open('dilated_cnn_weight_hexa.txt', 'r') as file:
    file_content = file.read()

/# Extract values and store them in the .mem file
extract_values(file_content, 'dilated_cnn_weight.mem')
Here's how the updated script works:
We define a function called extract_values that takes the file content and the output file name as parameters.
Inside the function, we open the output file in write mode using a with statement.
We use re.findall() with the regular expression r'"([0-9a-fA-F]+)"' to find all the values enclosed in double quotes. The regular expression matches any sequence of hexadecimal characters (0-9 and a-f/A-F) inside double quotes.
We iterate over each extracted value and write it to the output file, followed by a newline character ('\n').
We read the content from the text file ('dilated_cnn_weight_hexa.txt') and store it in the file_content variable.
We call the extract_values function, passing the file_content and the desired output file name ('dilated_cnn_weight.mem').
Run the updated script, and it will generate the 'dilated_cnn_weight.mem' file with all the extracted values, ignoring the property names.
Each value will be written on a separate line in the .mem file.
Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need any additional assistance!
