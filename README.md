  <p align="center">
    This project focuses on implementing Keyword Spotting (KWS) inference on a chip. 

Keyword Spotting Task is a classification Task: KWS aims to classify input signals to detect the presence or absence of specific keywords, such as "Hey Snips," in real-time.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Our Scope
General KWS Pipeline: The pipeline includes stages from the initial speech signal to the final decision.

Our Scope: We focus on the stages of the keyword spotting acoustic model right after feature extraction, ending just before posterior handling.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Hardware modules


### Overview


This is a simple outline for our RISC-V based KWS accelerator. 

Fixed-point arithmetic is adopted to simplify the hardwar design. To preserve the the fractional part of the data, we converted our weights and inputs to 32 bits fixed-point 1.7.24 format.That is 1 Sign bit, 7 bits for the integer part, 24 bits for the fractional part.

The input features and weights are initialized on the SRAM inside the user project area.<br>

The major components include <br>
	1. A finite state machine as a **controller** for fetching instructions and orchestrating other modules <br>
(CNN component below)<br>
    2.**CMVN pool** Cepstral mean and variance normalization pool. The input data is normalized and flattened here. <br>
    3.**Linear module** is adopted to **compute matrix multiplications** between two matrices of 50x20 and 20x20 for linear transformation. <br>
    4.**ReLU function module** to perform ReLU function <br> <br>
    5.**Dilated CNN module** to perform CNN with systolic array (to be tested) <br>
    6.**Batch normalize module** to be tested) <br>
    7.**Sigmoid Activation module** (to be tested) <br>

Our weights are store in 2 4kb SRAMs from Efabless marketplace

### Model


### Data
We use the "Hey Snips" dataset, which includes various voice commands from different speakers, providing a robust dataset for training. This dataset contains thousands of audio samples of different keywords, recorded by multiple speakers, including background noise and variations in speech patterns.

### Feature Extraction
Filter Bank: We use filter bank feature extraction to transform raw speech signals into a format suitable for the model. Filter banks decompose the signal into different frequency components, highlighting relevant features for speech recognition .After the filter bank, we padding the data so that it comes out the same size in each dimension.

### Structure
The model consists of multiple layers: CMVN (Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization), linear layers, ReLU activations, and dilated CNN blocks (repeated four times). Each dilated CNN block is followed by batch normalization and ReLU activations. The final layers include a linear layer and a sigmoid activation for binary classification.

### Why Dilated CNN 
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are chosen for their ability to handle temporal dependencies in speech signals. They capture features over larger time scales without significantly increasing computational load, making them ideal for real-time keyword spotting on limited-resource hardware.
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Working process: 
### Model Training:

Train the deep learning model using the prepared dataset. This involves data preprocessing, model selection, and optimization to ensure high accuracy in keyword detection.

Implementation in Python with pure tensor:
Implement the trained model in a Python environment, ensuring it is free from external library dependencies. This makes integration with hardware more straightforward.

### Weight Extraction:
Extract the model weights after the Python implementation. These weights are crucial for deploying the model on hardware.

### Implementation in Verilog:
Translate the Python implementation and extracted weights into Verilog for hardware implementation. This step involves designing the hardware description language suitable for chip design.

By implementing KWS inference on a chip, we aim to create a low-latency, efficient system capable of recognizing voice commands in real-time. This project leverages the latest advancements in deep learning and practical hardware implementation techniques to develop responsive and intelligent voice-controlled devices.
