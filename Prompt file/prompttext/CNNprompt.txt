Hi! i have a KWS accelerator with the following Micro architecture and ISA. I have also included a copy of our python code for the KWS accelerator called inference0519. I would like to implement it on Caravel Harness, a SoC. The KWS accelerator will be in the user project area wrapper of Caravel Harness, interface with a RISC-V core via wishbone bus. My calculation is in 32 fixed point data in 1.7.24 format, with 1 bit for sign, 7 bit for integer and 24 bit for fractions. My input file is a tensor in the shape of 50x20. The CNN module gets input from ReLU module. It interfaces ReLU module to get a input tensor, and give Batch Normalize its output. The CNN is controlled by a FSM. I have attached my verilog code for FSM(kws_fsm.txt), CMVN module(cmvn.txt) and ISA(KWS_ISA32.txt) for the KWS accelerator. I have also attached the original python code for the KWS model. According to these, can you write me a code in verilog for the CNN module?
