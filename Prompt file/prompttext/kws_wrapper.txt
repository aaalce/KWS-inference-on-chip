Hiya, I want to make a KWS accelerator on Caravel Harness, a SoC, in the user project area. Currently I have a CMVN module, Relu module, Linear module, dilated CNN module, Batch normalise module, a Sigmoid module and a FSM. I have attached my verilog code for FSM(kws_fsm.txt), CMVN module(cmvn.txt) and ISA(KWS_ISA32.txt) for the KWS accelerator. The KWS accelerator will be in the user project area wrapper of Caravel Harness, interface with a RISC-V core via wishbone bus. Can you produce a wishbone wrapper for CMVN and FSM? I have attached the example for example_module_wrapper
