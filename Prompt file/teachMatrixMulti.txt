Unfortunaly the code only gave me 416 outputs. I'll give you more examples: Example 1: for data [999] in the input, data 980 to 999 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 380 to 399 from the the linear weight, This action produces the output data [999]. Example 2: For data [21] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 20 to 39 from the the linear weight, This action produces the output data [21]. Example 3: For data [20] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 0 to 19 from the the linear weight, This action produces the output data [20].
Can you give me an example for data [30] and data [31] from the input, so i can make sure you understand?

I see what you are misunderstanding. For data [30] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 0 to 19 from the linear weight. This action produces the output data [30]. For data [31] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 20 to 39 from the linear weight. This action produces the output data [31]. This is because the data [30] and data [31] both have a row index of 3, but different column index of 0 and 1. [30] has a column index of 0, so it multiply and accumulate with 0 to 19 of the weights. [31] has a column index of 0, so it multiply and accumulate with 20 to 39 of the weights.
Can you give me an example of data [40] so we can see if you understand it now?
