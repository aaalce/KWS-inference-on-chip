01 Microarchitecture for KWS Accelerator


X
Hello again! I'm trying to design a KWS accelerator on Caravel Harness SoC. I have the following execution flow and ISA. Will you be able to come up with the microstructure of the accelerator?
Execution Flow:
1. Initialization:
   - The RISC-V core loads the input data into the accelerator's input buffer using the LOAD_INPUT instruction via the Wishbone bus.
   - The RISC-V core loads the model parameters into the accelerator's parameter memory using the LOAD_PARAM instruction via the Wishbone bus.
2. FSM Controller:
   - The FSM starts in an idle state and waits for the start signal from the RISC-V core.
   - Once the start signal is received, the FSM transitions to the execution states based on the pipeline sequence.
3. Execution States:
   - CMVN State: The systolic array performs CMVN normalization on the input data.
   - Linear State: The systolic array performs linear transformation using matrix-vector multiplication.
   - ReLU State: The ReLU unit applies the ReLU activation function to the output of the linear transformation.
   - Padding State: The systolic array applies padding to the input data for the Dilated CNN operation.
   - CNN State: The systolic array performs convolution operation on the padded or non-padded input data.
   - Batch Norm State: The systolic array performs batch normalization on the output of the CNN operation.
   - Sigmoid State: The Sigmoid unit applies the sigmoid activation function to the final output.
4. Output:
   - The final output is stored in the output buffer.
   - The RISC-V core retrieves the output results from the accelerator's output buffer using the STORE_OUTPUT instruction via the Wishbone bus.
The FSM controller orchestrates the transitions between the execution states based on the completion of each operation. It generates the necessary control signals for the systolic array, activation function units, and memory units to perform the required computations.
The systolic array architecture allows for efficient matrix-vector multiplications and convolutions by exploiting data reuse and parallel processing. The PEs in the systolic array communicate with their neighboring PEs to exchange data and perform the computations in a synchronized manner.
The Wishbone bus interface facilitates the communication between the RISC-V core and the accelerator, allowing the core to control and monitor the accelerator's operation and exchange data.

Claude:
Based on the provided execution flow and ISA, I can propose a microarchitecture for the KWS accelerator on the Caravel Harness SoC. Here's a high-level overview of the microarchitecture:
Input/Output Buffers:
Input Buffer: Stores the input data loaded by the RISC-V core using the LOAD_INPUT instruction.
Output Buffer: Stores the final output results to be retrieved by the RISC-V core using the STORE_OUTPUT instruction.

Stores the model parameters loaded by the RISC-V core using the LOAD_PARAM instruction.
Includes separate memory regions for linear weights, linear biases, CNN weights, CNN biases, batch normalization parameters (gamma, beta, mean, variance), CMVN mean, and CMVN inverse standard deviation.
Systolic Array:
Consists of an array of Processing Elements (PEs) arranged in a matrix configuration.
Each PE has a multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit and a local register file for storing intermediate results.
The PEs are interconnected to form a systolic data flow, allowing efficient matrix-vector multiplications and convolutions.
The systolic array is used for CMVN normalization, linear transformation, padding, and convolution operations.
Activation Function Units:
ReLU Unit: Applies the ReLU activation function to the output of the linear transformation.
Sigmoid Unit: Applies the sigmoid activation function to the final output.
FSM Controller:
Controls the overall execution flow of the accelerator based on the received instructions and status signals from the various components.
Generates control signals for the systolic array, activation function units, and memory units.
Manages the transitions between different execution states (CMVN, Linear, ReLU, Padding, CNN, Batch Norm, Sigmoid) based on the pipeline sequence.
Wishbone Bus Interface:
Provides an interface between the RISC-V core and the accelerator.
Allows the RISC-V core to load input data and model parameters, retrieve output results, and control the accelerator's execution using the defined instructions.
Configuration Registers:
Store configuration parameters such as kernel size, padding size, and memory addresses for various operations.
Accessible by the RISC-V core to configure the accelerator's behavior.
Data Path:
Connects the input/output buffers, parameter memory, systolic array, activation function units, and Wishbone bus interface.
Includes multiplexers and demultiplexers to route data between different components based on the current execution state.
Control Path:
Connects the FSM controller to the various components of the accelerator.
Carries control signals to orchestrate the execution flow and enable/disable specific components based on the current state.
The microarchitecture leverages the systolic array for efficient matrix-vector computations and convolutions, while the activation function units provide the necessary non-linear transformations. The FSM controller manages the execution flow and transitions between states based on the defined pipeline sequence.
The Wishbone bus interface allows seamless communication between the RISC-V core and the accelerator, enabling the core to control and configure the accelerator's operation using the provided instructions.
This is a high-level overview of the microarchitecture, and further refinements and optimizations can be made based on specific performance, area, and power requirements of the KWS accelerator.

Nice! Can you produce a specification for the parameter memory? It's 87,385 bytes.

Claude:
Certainly! Here's the specification for the parameter memory based on the provided size of 87,385 bytes:
Parameter Memory:
Purpose: Stores the model parameters loaded by the RISC-V core for use by the accelerator during execution.
Size: 87,385 bytes.
Memory Organization:
The parameter memory can be organized as a contiguous block of memory.
It can be divided into separate regions for different types of parameters (e.g., linear weights, linear biases, CNN weights, CNN biases, batch normalization parameters, CMVN mean, CMVN inverse standard deviation).
Each region can have a specific starting address and size based on the parameter requirements.
Data Type: The parameters are stored using 16-bit fixed-point data type.
Addressing: The parameters are accessed using their corresponding memory addresses.
The memory addresses for each parameter can be calculated based on the parameter type and its position within the respective parameter region.
Read/Write: The parameter memory is written by the RISC-V core using the LOAD_PARAM instruction and read by the accelerator during execution.
Interface: Connected to the Wishbone bus for data transfer from the RISC-V core and to the systolic array and other relevant components of the accelerator for parameter access.
Parameter Memory Organization:
The parameter memory can be divided into regions based on the different types of parameters required by the accelerator. For example:
Linear Weights: Starting address: 0x0000, Size: X bytes
Linear Biases: Starting address: 0x1000, Size: Y bytes
CNN Weights: Starting address: 0x2000, Size: Z bytes
CNN Biases: Starting address: 0x3000, Size: W bytes
Batch Normalization Parameters:
Gamma: Starting address: 0x4000, Size: P bytes
Beta: Starting address: 0x5000, Size: Q bytes
Mean: Starting address: 0x6000, Size: R bytes
Variance: Starting address: 0x7000, Size: S bytes
CMVN Mean: Starting address: 0x8000, Size: T bytes
CMVN Inverse Standard Deviation: Starting address: 0x9000, Size: U bytes
The actual sizes (X, Y, Z, W, P, Q, R, S, T, U) of each parameter region should be determined based on the specific requirements of your model and accelerator design.
Parameter Memory Control:
The RISC-V core loads the model parameters into the parameter memory using the LOAD_PARAM instruction, specifying the source memory address and size for each parameter type.
The accelerator reads the parameters from the parameter memory during execution, accessing them based on the current operation and the corresponding memory addresses.
Considerations:
Ensure that the total size of all parameter regions fits within the allocated 87,385 bytes of the parameter memory.
Align the parameter data in memory based on the 16-bit fixed-point data type to ensure efficient access.
Implement the necessary addressing logic to calculate the memory addresses for each parameter based on its type and position within the respective region.
Consider the access patterns and parallelism requirements of the accelerator when organizing the parameter memory and designing the memory interface.
By organizing the parameter memory into separate regions for each parameter type and providing appropriate addressing mechanisms, the accelerator can efficiently access the required parameters during execution.
Remember to carefully plan the memory layout, align the data properly, and optimize the memory access patterns to achieve the desired performance and efficiency in your accelerator design.

Now I need you to produce a specification for the Systolic Array. It should be able to accustom matrix multiplication, convolution and batch normalise. For example, for linear transformation, it does the operation y = x * W^T + b, where W^T is Weight transposed.
- x is the input tensor of shape [batch_size, input_features].
- W is the weight matrix of shape [output_features, input_features].
- b is the bias vector of shape [output_features].
- y is the output tensor of shape [batch_size, output_features].
For CNN, it consist of sliding the filter and doing element-wise multiplications at the position
I need my Array to be the small since I need to save design space.

Claude:
Certainly! Here's a specification for the Systolic Array that can accommodate matrix multiplication, convolution, and batch normalization operations while considering the need for a small design space:
Systolic Array:
Purpose: Performs matrix multiplication, convolution, and batch normalization operations in the accelerator.
Architecture:
The systolic array consists of a grid of Processing Elements (PEs) arranged in a rectangular shape.
Each PE contains a multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit and a small local memory for storing intermediate results.
The PEs are interconnected in a mesh-like topology, allowing data to flow between neighboring PEs.
Size:
The size of the systolic array can be determined based on the available design space and the maximum size of the matrices and filters required for the target application.
For example, a systolic array of size 8x8 or 16x16 can be considered as a starting point, depending on the resource constraints.
Processing Elements (PEs):
Each PE consists of a MAC unit capable of performing a single multiply-accumulate operation.
The MAC unit takes two 16-bit fixed-point inputs (one from the input data and one from the weight/filter) and produces a 32-bit fixed-point output.
The PE also includes a small local memory (e.g., a register file) to store intermediate results and accumulate the partial sums.
Data Flow:
For matrix multiplication (linear transformation):
The input data (x) is streamed into the systolic array from one side (e.g., left), and the transposed weight matrix (W^T) is streamed from the top.
The PEs perform the matrix multiplication by passing the input data and weights through the array, performing MAC operations, and accumulating the partial sums.
The bias vector (b) is added to the output of the matrix multiplication.
For convolution (CNN):
The input data (feature map) is streamed into the systolic array from one side (e.g., left), and the filters are streamed from the top.
The PEs perform the convolution operation by sliding the filters over the input data, performing element-wise multiplications, and accumulating the results.
The output feature map is generated by collecting the results from the PEs.
For batch normalization:
The input data (feature map) is streamed into the systolic array from one side (e.g., left).
The PEs perform the batch normalization operation by applying the scaling and shifting factors (gamma and beta) to the input data.
The mean and variance parameters are used to normalize the input data.
Control and Configuration:
The systolic array is controlled by the FSM controller, which generates the necessary control signals for data flow and execution.
The configuration of the systolic array (e.g., matrix sizes, filter sizes, strides) is programmed by the RISC-V core through configuration registers.
Interconnect:
The systolic array is connected to the input/output buffers and the parameter memory through a dedicated interconnect.
The interconnect allows efficient data transfer between the systolic array and the memory components.
Considerations:
The systolic array should be designed to support the maximum matrix and filter sizes required for the target application.
The number of PEs and their arrangement can be optimized based on the available design space and performance requirements.
The data flow and control mechanisms should be carefully designed to ensure efficient utilization of the PEs and minimize data movement.
The fixed-point precision (16-bit) can be adjusted based on the accuracy requirements of the application.
The local memory within each PE should be kept small to minimize the overall design space.
By designing a compact systolic array with a limited number of PEs and optimizing the data flow and control mechanisms, you can achieve a balance between performance and design space efficiency for your accelerator.
Remember to validate the functionality and performance of the systolic array through simulations and hardware testing to ensure it meets the requirements of your target application.

Certainly! Here's a specification for the FSM (Finite State Machine) Controller in your accelerator:
FSM Controller:
Purpose: Controls the overall execution flow and manages the transitions between different states of the accelerator.
Inputs:
Start signal from the RISC-V core to initiate the execution.
Done signals from various components (e.g., systolic array, activation units) indicating the completion of their respective operations.
Configuration signals from the RISC-V core specifying the operation types and parameters.
Outputs:
Control signals to the systolic array, activation units, and memory components to orchestrate their operation.
Handshake signals to the RISC-V core to indicate the status of the accelerator (e.g., busy, done).
States:
Idle: The default state when the accelerator is not executing any operation.
Load: The state in which the input data and parameters are loaded into the respective buffers and memory components.
CMVN: The state in which the systolic array performs CMVN normalization on the input data.
Linear: The state in which the systolic array performs linear transformation (matrix multiplication) on the input data.
ReLU: The state in which the ReLU activation unit applies the ReLU function to the output of the linear transformation.
Padding: The state in which the systolic array applies padding to the input data for the convolution operation.
CNN: The state in which the systolic array performs the convolution operation on the input data.
Batch Norm: The state in which the systolic array performs batch normalization on the output of the convolution operation.
Sigmoid: The state in which the Sigmoid activation unit applies the sigmoid function to the final output.
Store: The state in which the final output is stored in the output buffer for retrieval by the RISC-V core.
State Transitions:
The FSM controller transitions between states based on the completion of operations and the configuration signals from the RISC-V core.
The state transitions follow the execution flow specified in the accelerator's pipeline.
The FSM controller generates the appropriate control signals to activate and deactivate the corresponding components in each state.
Control Signals:
The FSM controller generates control signals to manage the data flow and execution of the systolic array, activation units, and memory components.
Examples of control signals include:
Systolic array: Start, mode (matrix multiplication, convolution), stride, padding, etc.
Activation units: Start, mode (ReLU, Sigmoid), etc.
Memory components: Read/write enable, address generation, etc.
Handshake with RISC-V Core:
The FSM controller communicates with the RISC-V core through handshake signals.
It receives the start signal from the RISC-V core to initiate the execution.
It sends a busy signal to the RISC-V core to indicate that the accelerator is currently executing an operation.
It sends a done signal to the RISC-V core to indicate the completion of the execution.
Error Handling:
The FSM controller should include error handling mechanisms to detect and handle any exceptional conditions or errors that may occur during execution.
It should have appropriate error states and transitions to gracefully handle and recover from error scenarios.
Considerations:
The FSM controller should be designed to ensure the correct sequencing and synchronization of operations in the accelerator pipeline.
It should handle the dependencies between different states and ensure that the necessary preconditions are met before transitioning to the next state.
The FSM controller should be optimized for speed and resource utilization, considering the timing constraints and available hardware resources.
It should be flexible and configurable to support different operation modes and parameters based on the configuration signals from the RISC-V core.
The FSM controller plays a crucial role in orchestrating the overall execution flow of the accelerator and managing the interactions between different components. By carefully designing the states, transitions, and control signals, you can ensure the correct and efficient operation of your accelerator.
Remember to validate the functionality of the FSM controller through simulations and hardware testing to verify its behavior and catch any potential issues or deadlocks.

This updated specification reflects the correct pipeline sequence and provides the input and output interfaces for each module in your accelerator design. The modules are connected in the specified order, with the output tensor of one module being passed as input to the next module according to the pipeline.
Remember to implement the necessary control logic and data paths to ensure the correct flow of data between the modules and the proper execution of the pipeline. Additionally, ensure that the systolic array is configured and utilized appropriately for the Linear, Dilated CNN, and CNN layers.

apologies, I need to clarify: first, my KWS accelerator is interfacing with a wishbone slave port, meaning i don't have the direct access to the RAM, second, with the pipeline and the new information, can you update the microarchitecture you previously generated, with input and output interface specified?

Claude:Apologies for the confusion. Let me update the microarchitecture of your KWS accelerator based on the new information you provided, including the Wishbone slave port interface and the updated pipeline. Here's the updated microarchitecture:
Wishbone Slave Interface:
Provides an interface between the KWS accelerator and the Wishbone bus.
Receives control signals and data from the master (RISC-V core) via the Wishbone bus.
Handles read and write requests from the master to the accelerator's internal registers and buffers.
Input: Wishbone bus signals (data, address, control, etc.).
Output: Data and status signals to the Wishbone bus.
Configuration and Status Registers (CSRs):
Store configuration parameters and status information for the accelerator.
Accessible by the RISC-V core via the Wishbone slave interface.
Input: Read and write requests from the Wishbone slave interface.
Output: Configuration data to the accelerator's internal modules and status data to the Wishbone slave interface.
Input Buffer:
Stores the input data received from the RISC-V core via the Wishbone slave interface.
Provides input data to the CMVN module.
Input: Data from the Wishbone slave interface.
Output: Input data tensor to the CMVN module.
Output Buffer:
Stores the final output data from the Sigmoid module.
Provides output data to the RISC-V core via the Wishbone slave interface.
Input: Final output tensor from the Sigmoid module.
Output: Output data to the Wishbone slave interface.
CMVN Module:
Applies Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization (CMVN) to the input data.
Input: Input data tensor from the Input Buffer.
Output: Normalized input data tensor to the Linear module.
Linear Module:
Performs linear transformation on the normalized input data using matrix multiplication.
Utilizes the systolic array for matrix multiplication.
Input: Normalized input data tensor from the CMVN module.
Output: Linearly transformed output tensor to the ReLU module.
ReLU Module:
Applies the ReLU activation function element-wise to the input tensor.
Input: Output tensor from the Linear, Batch Normalize, or CNN module.
Output: Activated output tensor to the next module (Padding or next layer).
Padding Module:
Adds padding to the input tensor based on the specified padding size.
Input: Output tensor from the ReLU or Batch Normalize module.
Output: Padded input tensor to the Dilated CNN module.
Dilated CNN Module:
Performs dilated convolution on the padded input tensor using the specified filters and dilation rate.
Utilizes the systolic array for convolution operation.
Input: Padded input tensor from the Padding module.
Output: Output tensor after dilated convolution to the Batch Normalize module.
Batch Normalize Module:
Applies batch normalization to the input tensor, normalizing the activations across the batch.
Input: Output tensor from the Dilated CNN or CNN module.
Output: Normalized output tensor to the ReLU module.
CNN Module:
Performs standard convolution on the input tensor using the specified filters.
Utilizes the systolic array for convolution operation.
Input: Output tensor from the ReLU or Batch Normalize module.
Output: Output tensor after convolution to the Batch Normalize module.
Sigmoid Module:
Applies the sigmoid activation function element-wise to the input tensor.
Input: Output tensor from the final Linear module.
Output: Final output tensor to the Output Buffer.
FSM Controller:
Controls the overall execution flow of the accelerator based on the pipeline sequence.
Generates control signals for the systolic array, activation modules, padding module, and batch normalization module.
Communicates with the RISC-V core via the Wishbone slave interface for handshake and status signals.
Input: Control signals from the Wishbone slave interface and status signals from the internal modules.
Output: Control signals to the internal modules and status signals to the Wishbone slave interface.
Systolic Array:
Performs matrix multiplication and convolution operations for the Linear, Dilated CNN, and CNN modules.
Receives control signals from the FSM controller to configure its operation based on the layer type.
Input: Input data and weights/filters from the respective modules.
Output: Output data to the respective modules.
The updated microarchitecture incorporates the Wishbone slave interface for communication with the RISC-V core, and the data flow follows the specified pipeline sequence. The input data is received via the Wishbone slave interface and stored in the Input Buffer. The data then flows through the pipeline modules in the following order: CMVN, Linear, ReLU, Padding, Dilated CNN, Batch Normalize, ReLU, CNN, Batch Normalize, ReLU (repeated based on the pipeline), Linear, and Sigmoid. The final output is stored in the Output Buffer and can be accessed by the RISC-V core via the Wishbone slave interface.
The FSM controller orchestrates the execution flow and generates control signals for the internal modules. The systolic array is utilized for matrix multiplication and convolution operations in the Linear, Dilated CNN, and CNN modules.
Please note that this is a high-level microarchitecture, and you would need to further refine and implement the details of each module, the interconnections, and the control logic based on your specific requirements and constraints.
