Hi! i have a KWS accelerator with the following Micro architecture and ISA. I have also included a copy of our python code for the KWS accelerator called inference0510. I would like to implement it on Caravel Harness, a SoC. The KWS accelerator will be in the user project area wrapper of Caravel Harness, interface with a RISC-V core via wishbone bus. According to these, can you write me a code in verilog for the CMVN Module?

Claude:
Certainly! Here's a Verilog code for the CMVN (Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization) module based on the provided microarchitecture and ISA:

Explanation:
The CMVN module takes the following inputs:
clk: Clock signal
rst: Reset signal
start: Start signal to initiate the CMVN operation
mean_address: Memory address of the mean value
istd_address: Memory address of the inverse standard deviation value
input_data: Input data to be normalized
The module has the following outputs:
output_data: Normalized output data
done: Signal indicating the completion of the CMVN operation
The module uses a state machine with four states:
IDLE: Waiting for the start signal
LOAD_PARAMS: Loading the mean and istd values from memory
NORMALIZE: Performing the CMVN normalization on the input data
DONE: Indicating the completion of the CMVN operation
In the LOAD_PARAMS state, the module loads the mean and istd values from memory using the provided memory addresses.
In the NORMALIZE state, the module performs the CMVN normalization by subtracting the mean value from the input data and multiplying the result by the istd value. The result is then shifted right by 8 bits to adjust for fixed-point arithmetic.
The module uses a counter to keep track of the number of input data samples processed. When the counter reaches 255 (assuming 256 input samples), the module transitions to the DONE state.
In the DONE state, the done signal is asserted to indicate the completion of the CMVN operation, and the module returns to the IDLE state.
Note: The code assumes the presence of a memory module named memory that holds the mean and istd values. You'll need to ensure that the memory is properly initialized with the correct values before running the CMVN module.

Hey, i just changed my design to 32bit. I have attached the new ISA. Can you make the changes accordingly?

Claude:
Certainly! Here's the updated Verilog code for the CMVN (Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization) module based on the 32-bit ISA:
verilog

Copy code
module cmvn (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input start,
    input [31:0] input_data,
    input [31:0] cmvn_mean,
    input [31:0] cmvn_istd,
    output reg [31:0] output_data,
    output reg done

    reg [7:0] counter;

    // State machine
    reg [1:0] state;
    localparam IDLE = 2'b00;
    localparam NORMALIZE = 2'b01;
    localparam DONE = 2'b10;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst) begin
            state <= IDLE;
            counter <= 8'b0;
            done <= 1'b0;

                        state <= NORMALIZE;
                    end
                end

                NORMALIZE: begin
                    // Perform CMVN normalization
                    output_data <= $signed(($signed(input_data) - $signed(cmvn_mean)) * $signed(cmvn_istd)) >>> 8;
                    counter <= counter + 1;

                    if (counter == 8'd255) begin
                        state <= DONE;
                    end
                end

                DONE: begin
                    done <= 1'b1;
                    state <= IDLE;
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
Explanation:
The CMVN module now takes 32-bit inputs:
input_data: Input data to be normalized
cmvn_mean: Mean value for CMVN normalization
cmvn_istd: Inverse standard deviation value for CMVN normalization
The module has the following outputs:
output_data: 32-bit normalized output data
done: Signal indicating the completion of the CMVN operation
The module uses a simplified state machine with three states:
IDLE: Waiting for the start signal
NORMALIZE: Performing the CMVN normalization on the input data
DONE: Indicating the completion of the CMVN operation
In the NORMALIZE state, the module performs the CMVN normalization by subtracting the cmvn_mean value from the input_data and multiplying the result by the cmvn_istd value. The result is then shifted right by 8 bits to adjust for fixed-point arithmetic.
The module uses a counter to keep track of the number of input data samples processed. When the counter reaches 255 (assuming 256 input samples), the module transitions to the DONE state.
In the DONE state, the done signal is asserted to indicate the completion of the CMVN operation, and the module returns to the IDLE state.
The main changes compared to the previous version are:
The input and output data widths are now 32 bits, as per the updated ISA.
The LOAD_PARAMS state is removed since the cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd values are now provided as direct inputs to the module.
The memory-related signals and addresses are removed since the module no longer interacts with memory directly.
Note: Make sure to provide the appropriate cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd values as inputs to the CMVN module during execution.

Connect the cmvn_en signal from the FSM controller to the CMVN module.
Connect the input_data from the Input Buffer to the CMVN module. Can you tell me how to do those? I already have a file for the FSM controller. Do i need to make a file for the Input buffer?

Claude:
Certainly! Here's how you can connect the cmvn_en signal from the FSM controller and the input_data from the Input Buffer to the CMVN module:
Connecting the cmvn_en signal from the FSM controller:
In the FSM controller module, declare an output signal called cmvn_en:
verilog

Copy code
module fsm_controller (
    // ...
    output reg cmvn_en,
    // ...
);
In the FSM controller's state machine, assert the cmvn_en signal when you want to enable the CMVN module, and deassert it otherwise. For example:
verilog

Copy code
always @(posedge clk) begin
    // ...
    case (state)
        // ...
        CMVN_STATE: begin
            cmvn_en <= 1'b1;
            // ...
        end
        // ...
        default: begin
            cmvn_en <= 1'b0;
            // ...
        end
    endcase
    // ...
end
Connect the cmvn_en signal from the FSM controller to the CMVN module in the top-level module:
verilog

Copy code
module top_level (
    // ...
    wire cmvn_en;
    // ...
    fsm_controller fsm_inst (
        // ...
        .cmvn_en(cmvn_en),
        // ...
    );
    
    cmvn cmvn_inst (
        // ...
        .enable(cmvn_en),
        // ...
    );
    // ...
endmodule
Connecting the input_data from the Input Buffer:
Create a separate module for the Input Buffer:
verilog

Copy code
module input_buffer (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [31:0] data_in,
    input write_en,
    output reg [31:0] data_out
);

    // Implement the input buffer functionality
    // ...

endmodule
In the top-level module, instantiate the Input Buffer and connect its data_out to the CMVN module:
verilog

Copy code
module top_level (
    // ...
    wire [31:0] input_data;
    // ...
    input_buffer input_buffer_inst (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .data_in(data_from_core),
        .write_en(write_en_from_core),
        .data_out(input_data)
    );
    
    cmvn cmvn_inst (
        // ...
        .input_data(input_data),
        // ...
    );
    // ...
endmodule
Note: Make sure to implement the necessary logic inside the Input Buffer module to store and provide the input data as required by your design.
By following these steps, you will connect the cmvn_en signal from the FSM controller to enable/disable the CMVN module, and connect the input_data from the Input Buffer to provide the input data to the CMVN module.
Remember to adapt the code snippets to fit your specific design and module names, and ensure proper synchronization and control flow between the modules.

X:
my input is a matrix of [50,20], in the input file test1.txt. "logits" is the result came out from KWS. there are 20 cmvn_mean and 20 cmvn_istd in the file CMVNpara.txt. How should I design the buffer?

Claude:
To design the buffer for your CMVN module, you need to consider the input matrix size and the number of CMVN parameters (mean and istd). Here's how you can design the buffer:
Input Buffer:
The input matrix has a size of [50, 20], so you need a buffer that can store 50 rows of 20 elements each.
Declare a register array to store the input data:
verilog

Copy code
reg [31:0] input_buffer [0:49][0:19];
This creates a 2D array of 50 rows and 20 columns, where each element is a 32-bit value.
CMVN Parameter Buffer:
You have 20 CMVN mean values and 20 CMVN istd values.
Declare two register arrays to store the CMVN parameters:
verilog

Copy code
reg [31:0] cmvn_mean [0:19];
reg [31:0] cmvn_istd [0:19];
Each array has 20 elements, where each element is a 32-bit value.
Output Buffer:
The output matrix will have the same size as the input matrix, [50, 20].
Declare a register array to store the output data:
verilog

Copy code
reg [31:0] output_buffer [0:49][0:19];
This creates a 2D array of 50 rows and 20 columns, where each element is a 32-bit value.
Buffer Initialization:
In the CMVN module, you need to initialize the CMVN parameter buffers with the values provided in the "CMVNpara.txt" file.
You can initialize the buffers in the module's initial block:
verilog

Copy code
initial begin
    // Initialize CMVN mean buffer
    cmvn_mean[0] = 32'd241192656;
    cmvn_mean[1] = 32'd268649632;
    // ... initialize other mean values ...
    
    // Initialize CMVN istd buffer
    cmvn_istd[0] = 32'd2730620;
    cmvn_istd[1] = 32'd2558343;
    // ... initialize other istd values ...
end
Data Processing:
In the CMVN module, you need to iterate over the input buffer, perform the CMVN normalization for each element using the corresponding CMVN mean and istd values, and store the result in the output buffer.
You can use nested loops to access the input buffer elements and perform the CMVN calculation:
verilog

Copy code
integer i, j;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (start) begin
        for (i = 0; i < 50; i = i + 1) begin
            for (j = 0; j < 20; j = j + 1) begin
                output_buffer[i][j] <= $signed(($signed(input_buffer[i][j]) - $signed(cmvn_mean[j])) * $signed(cmvn_istd[j])) >>> 8;
            end
        end
    end
end
By designing the buffer in this way, you can store the input matrix, CMVN parameters, and output matrix efficiently in the CMVN module. The module can then iterate over the input buffer, perform the CMVN normalization using the corresponding CMVN parameters, and store the results in the output buffer.
Remember to handle the loading of input data into the input buffer and the retrieval of output data from the output buffer based on your overall system design and interface with the other modules.

X:
cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd only need to be load once and the data doesnt change. Can i make a register file for it and preload it instead of asking the FSM to load it?

Claude:
Yes, you can definitely create a register file for the CMVN mean and istd values and preload them instead of relying on the FSM to load them. This approach is more efficient since the CMVN parameters remain constant throughout the computation.
Here's how you can modify the CMVN module to use a register file for the CMVN parameters:
CMVN Parameter Register File:
Declare two register arrays to store the CMVN mean and istd values:
verilog

Copy code
reg [31:0] cmvn_mean [0:19];
reg [31:0] cmvn_istd [0:19];
Preloading CMVN Parameters:
Instead of initializing the CMVN parameters in the module's initial block, you can preload them using a separate Verilog file or a memory initialization file (MIF).
Create a separate Verilog file (e.g., "cmvn_params.v") with the CMVN parameter values:
verilog

Copy code
// cmvn_params.v

// CMVN mean values
cmvn_mean[0] = 32'd241192656;
cmvn_mean[1] = 32'd268649632;
// ... other mean values ...

// CMVN istd values
cmvn_istd[0] = 32'd2730620;
cmvn_istd[1] = 32'd2558343;
// ... other istd values ...
Instantiating the CMVN Parameter Register File:
In the CMVN module, instantiate the CMVN parameter register file using the preloaded values:
verilog

Copy code
// Instantiate CMVN parameter register file
reg [31:0] cmvn_mean [0:19];
reg [31:0] cmvn_istd [0:19];

initial begin
    $readmemh("cmvn_params.v", cmvn_mean);
    $readmemh("cmvn_params.v", cmvn_istd);
end
The $readmemh function reads the CMVN parameter values from the specified file ("cmvn_params.v") and initializes the cmvn_mean and cmvn_istd register arrays.
Using the CMVN Parameter Register File:
In the CMVN module, you can directly access the CMVN mean and istd values from the register file during the CMVN computation:
verilog

Copy code
integer i, j;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (start) begin
        for (i = 0; i < 50; i = i + 1) begin
            for (j = 0; j < 20; j = j + 1) begin
                output_buffer[i][j] <= $signed(($signed(input_buffer[i][j]) - $signed(cmvn_mean[j])) * $signed(cmvn_istd[j])) >>> 8;
            end
        end
    end
end
By using a register file for the CMVN parameters and preloading them, you eliminate the need for the FSM to load these values. The CMVN module can directly access the parameter values from the register file during the computation, making the process more efficient.
Remember to include the "cmvn_params.v" file in your project and ensure that the file path is correctly specified in the $readmemh function call.
This approach simplifies the CMVN module's interface and reduces the complexity of the FSM, as it no longer needs to handle the loading of CMVN parameters.
