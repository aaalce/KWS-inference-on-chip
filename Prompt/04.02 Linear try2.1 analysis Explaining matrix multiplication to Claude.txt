Hiya, I have the following code. Can you tell me what it's doing?
The provided code is a Verilog module named "linear" that implements a linear layer in a neural network. Here's a high-level overview of what the module does:
The module takes several inputs, including a clock signal (clk), reset signal (rst_n), enable signal (linear_en), input data (input_data), and input address (input_addr).
It instantiates an SRAM module (SRAM_1024x32) to store the linear weights. The SRAM is accessed using a Wishbone interface.
The module has a state machine with four states: IDLE, MULTIPLY, ACCUMULATE, and OUTPUT.
In the IDLE state, the module waits for the linear_en signal to be asserted to start the linear layer computation.
In the MULTIPLY state, the module reads the linear weight from the SRAM using the input address (input_addr) and performs a signed multiplication between the input data and the weight. The multiplication result is stored in the mult_result register.
In the ACCUMULATE state, the module accumulates the multiplication results by adding them to the acc_result register. It also increments the input_counter to keep track of the number of input data processed.
If the input_counter reaches 20, the module transitions to the OUTPUT state. Otherwise, it goes back to the MULTIPLY state to process the next input data.
In the OUTPUT state, the accumulated result (acc_result) is assigned to the output_data, and the corresponding input address is assigned to the output_addr. The output_valid signal is set to indicate that the output data is valid.
The module uses intermediate registers (mult_result and acc_result) to store the multiplication and accumulation results.
The module includes debug statements ($display) to print out the values of input data, weight, multiplication result, and accumulation result at different stages of the computation.
Overall, this module performs a linear layer computation by reading the linear weights from an SRAM, multiplying them with the input data, accumulating the results, and outputting the final result along with the corresponding input address.

can you tell me a bit more about the multiply and accumulated calculation in this code please?
Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the multiplication and accumulation operations performed in this code.
Multiplication:
In the MULTIPLY state, the module reads the linear weight from the SRAM using the input address (input_addr) and the input_counter. The input address represents the starting address of the weights for the current input data, and the input_counter is used as an offset to access the specific weight corresponding to the current input data.
The weight is read from the SRAM using the Wishbone interface. The module sets the appropriate Wishbone signals (wbs_stb_i, wbs_cyc_i, wbs_we_i, wbs_sel_i, wbs_adr_i) to initiate a read operation. It then waits for the SRAM read acknowledgment (wbs_ack_o) to receive the weight data.
Once the weight is obtained from the SRAM, the module performs a signed multiplication between the input data (input_data) and the weight (wbs_dat_o). The multiplication result is stored in the mult_result register, which is a 64-bit signed register to accommodate the expanded result.
Accumulation:
In the ACCUMULATE state, the module accumulates the multiplication results. It adds the current multiplication result (mult_result) to the existing accumulation result stored in the acc_result register. The accumulation is performed using signed addition.
However, before adding the multiplication result to the accumulation, the code truncates the multiplication result to a specific format. It takes bits [55:24] of the mult_result, which corresponds to a 1.7.24 fixed-point format. This truncation is likely done to manage the precision and range of the accumulated result.
After the accumulation, the input_counter is incremented to move to the next input data.
The module continues to alternate between the MULTIPLY and ACCUMULATE states until all the input data (20 in this case) have been processed. Once all the input data have been multiplied and accumulated, the module transitions to the OUTPUT state to provide the final result.
The acc_result register holds the final accumulated result, which represents the output of the linear layer for the given input data.
It's worth noting that the code includes debug statements ($display) to print the values of the input data, weight, multiplication result, and accumulation result at different stages. These statements can be helpful for debugging and monitoring the computation process.
Overall, the multiplication and accumulation operations in this code are performed iteratively for each input data. The weights are read from the SRAM, multiplied with the input data, and the results are accumulated to obtain the final output of the linear layer.

The error messages indicate some issues with the port connections and assignments in the Verilog code. Let's go through each error and warning:
Error: ack_o Unable to assign to unresolved wires.
This error occurs in the SRAM_1024x32.v file at lines 99 and 104.
It suggests that the ack_o output port is not properly declared or connected in the SRAM_1024x32 module.
Error: dat_o Unable to assign to unresolved wires.
This error occurs in the SRAM_1024x32.v file at lines 100 and 105.
Similar to the previous error, it indicates that the dat_o output port is not properly declared or connected in the SRAM_1024x32 module.
Warning: Port 6 (wbs_sel_i) of SRAM_1024x32 expects 4 bits, got 1.
This warning occurs in the linear.v file at line 34.
It suggests that the wbs_sel_i input port of the SRAM_1024x32 module expects a 4-bit value, but the connection in the linear module provides only 1 bit.
The simulator automatically pads the 3 high bits of the port to match the expected width.
Warning: Port 8 (wbs_adr_i) of SRAM_1024x32 expects 32 bits, got 1.
This warning occurs in the linear.v file at line 34.
It suggests that the wbs_adr_i input port of the SRAM_1024x32 module expects a 32-bit value, but the connection in the linear module provides only 1 bit.
The simulator automatically pads the 31 high bits of the port to match the expected width.
To resolve these issues, you should:
Check the declaration and assignment of the ack_o and dat_o output ports in the SRAM_1024x32 module.
Make sure they are properly declared as output ports and assigned valid values.
Ensure that the wbs_sel_i port in the linear module is connected with a 4-bit value.
If the wbs_sel_i signal is intended to be a single bit, you can modify the port width in the SRAM_1024x32 module to match.
Ensure that the wbs_adr_i port in the linear module is connected with a 32-bit value.
If the wbs_adr_i signal is intended to be a smaller width, you can modify the port width in the SRAM_1024x32 module to match.
Once you address these issues in the respective Verilog files, the errors and warnings should be resolved, and the compilation should proceed without errors.

The main changes made are:
In linear.v:
The wbs_adr_i port width is updated to 32 bits to match the SRAM_1024x32 module.
The wbs_sel_i port width is updated to 4 bits to match the SRAM_1024x32 module.
The output_addr width is updated to 10 bits to match the input address width.
In SRAM_1024x32.v:
The wbs_ack_o and wbs_dat_o signals are directly assigned in the always block, removing the intermediate ack_o and dat_o signals.
These changes should resolve the errors and warnings you encountered earlier. Please make sure to also include the ram_controller and EF_SRAM_1024x32_wrapper modules in your design, as they are instantiated in the SRAM_1024x32 module.

i have checked my output, there are only 400 outputs. The rest is null. Can you explain the calculation logic from the original code a bit more?
Certainly! Let's go through the calculation logic in the original code step by step.
The code implements a linear layer module that takes input data, multiplies it with corresponding weights stored in the SRAM, and accumulates the results to produce the output.
The module has a state machine with four states: IDLE, MULTIPLY, ACCUMULATE, and OUTPUT.
In the IDLE state, the module waits for the linear_en signal to be asserted, indicating that the linear layer calculation should start.
When linear_en is asserted, the module transitions to the MULTIPLY state.
In the MULTIPLY state:
The module reads the linear weight from the SRAM using the input_addr and input_counter to determine the memory address.
It initiates a read operation by setting the appropriate Wishbone signals (wbs_stb_i, wbs_cyc_i, wbs_we_i, wbs_sel_i, wbs_adr_i).
It waits for the SRAM read acknowledgment (wbs_ack_o).
Once the weight is obtained from the SRAM, the module performs a signed multiplication between the input_data and the weight (wbs_dat_o).
The multiplication result is stored in the mult_result register.
After the multiplication, the module transitions to the ACCUMULATE state.
In the ACCUMULATE state:
The module accumulates the multiplication result by adding it to the existing acc_result register.
The multiplication result is truncated to a 1.7.24 fixed-point format before accumulation.
The input_counter is incremented to move to the next input data.
If the input_counter is less than 20, the module goes back to the MULTIPLY state to process the next input data.
If the input_counter reaches 20, the module transitions to the OUTPUT state.
In the OUTPUT state:
The accumulated result (acc_result) is assigned to the output_data.
The corresponding input_addr is assigned to the output_addr.
The output_valid signal is set to indicate that the output data is valid.
After the OUTPUT state, the module transitions back to the IDLE state, waiting for the next linear_en signal.
Based on this logic, the module performs the linear layer calculation for 20 input data points. It reads the corresponding weights from the SRAM, multiplies them with the input data, accumulates the results, and outputs the final result for each input address.
If you are observing only 400 outputs with the rest being null, it suggests that the module is processing only a subset of the input data. This could be due to several reasons:
The linear_en signal might not be asserted for all the input data.
The SRAM might not contain weights for all the input addresses.
The input data might be limited to 400 valid values.
To further investigate the issue, you can:
Check the assertion of the linear_en signal and ensure it is asserted for all the desired input data.
Verify that the SRAM contains the necessary weights for all the input addresses.
Examine the input data and ensure it contains valid values for all the expected inputs.
Additionally, you can add more debug statements or waveform analysis to track the values of input_counter, input_addr, and other relevant signals to pinpoint where the calculation stops or where the null outputs start occurring.

X
for each input, the subset it belongs, for example, for data [3] in the input, data 0 to 19 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 60 to79 from the the linear weight. This action produces the output data [3]. Another example is, for data [0] in the input, data data 0 to 19 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 0 to 19 from the the linear weight, This action produces the output data [0]. So over 1000(50 subsets) of data, there should be 1000 output. Is the calculation logic clear to you now?
Yes, thank you for providing the additional information about the calculation logic. I understand now that each output data point is calculated using a specific subset of the input data and a corresponding subset of the linear weights from the SRAM.
To implement this logic, we need to make some modifications to the code. Here's an updated version of the linear.v module that should produce 1000 output data points based on the calculation logic you described:

The main changes made are:
In the MULTIPLY state, the wbs_adr_i signal is modified to use input_addr[9:5] as the subset index. This ensures that each output data point is calculated using the corresponding subset of linear weights from the SRAM.
The wbs_adr_i signal in the output logic is also updated to use input_addr[9:5] as the subset index and input_counter[4:0] as the offset within the subset. This allows the module to access the correct linear weights for each input data point.
With these modifications, the module should now calculate 1000 output data points, where each output data point is produced by multiplying and accumulating the corresponding subset of input data with the corresponding subset of linear weights from the SRAM.
Please note that you may need to adjust the SRAM initialization file (weights_init_0.mem) to ensure that it contains the correct linear weights for each subset.

This code includes the updated calculation logic where each output data point is calculated using a specific subset of the input data and the corresponding subset of linear weights from the SRAM.
The main changes compared to the previous version are:
The input_counter is now a 5-bit register to accommodate the subset size of 20.
In the MULTIPLY state, the wbs_adr_i signal is modified to use input_addr[9:5] as the subset index and 5'b00000 as the base address for each subset.
In the output logic, the wbs_adr_i signal is updated to use input_addr[9:5] as the subset index and input_counter as the offset within the subset.
Please note that you also need to ensure that the SRAM initialization file (weights_init_0.mem) contains the correct linear weights for each subset.
With these modifications, the linear.v module should produce 1000 output data points, where each output data point is calculated by multiplying and accumulating the corresponding subset of input data with the corresponding subset of linear weights from the SRAM.

Unfortunaly the code only gave me 416 outputs. I'll give you more examples: Example 1: for data [999] in the input, data 980 to 999 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 380 to 399 from the the linear weight, This action produces the output data [999]. Example 2: For data [21] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 20 to 39 from the the linear weight, This action produces the output data [21]. Example 3: For data [20] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 0 to 19 from the the linear weight, This action produces the output data [20].
Can you give me an example for data [30] and data [31] from the input, so i can make sure you understand?
Certainly! Let me provide examples for data [30] and data [31] from the input based on the calculation logic you described.
Example 4: For data [30] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 200 to 219 from the linear weight. This action produces the output data [30].
Example 5: For data [31] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 220 to 239 from the linear weight. This action produces the output data [31].
In these examples, the input data is divided into subsets of 20 elements each. The subset containing data [30] and data [31] is from index 20 to 39 in the input.
For data [30], the corresponding linear weights are from index 200 to 219, which is calculated by taking the input data index (30) modulo 20 and multiplying it by 20 to get the starting index of the linear weights.
Similarly, for data [31], the corresponding linear weights are from index 220 to 239, which is calculated by taking the input data index (31) modulo 20 and multiplying it by 20 to get the starting index of the linear weights.
The calculation logic can be summarized as follows:
Determine the subset of input data based on the input data index.
Calculate the starting index of the corresponding linear weights using the formula: (input_data_index % 20) * 20.
Multiply and accumulate the input data subset with the corresponding linear weight subset to produce the output data.
I hope this clarifies the calculation logic for you. Let me know if you have any further questions!

I see what you are misunderstanding. For data [30] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 0 to 19 from the linear weight. This action produces the output data [30]. For data [31] in the input, data 20 to 39 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 20 to 39 from the linear weight. This action produces the output data [31]. This is because the data [30] and data [31] both have a row index of 3, but different column index of 0 and 1. [30] has a column index of 0, so it multiply and accumulate with 0 to 19 of the weights. [31] has a column index of 0, so it multiply and accumulate with 20 to 39 of the weights.
Can you give me an example of data [40] so we can see if you understand it now?
I apologize for the misunderstanding. Thank you for clarifying the calculation logic. Let me provide the example for data [40] based on your explanation.
Example 6: For data [40] in the input, data 40 to 59 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 0 to 19 from the linear weight. This action produces the output data [40].
In this example, data [40] belongs to the subset of input data from index 40 to 59. The row index of data [40] is 4 (40 / 20 = 2), and the column index is 0 (40 % 20 = 0).
Since the column index is 0, the corresponding linear weights for data [40] are from index 0 to 19.
The calculation logic can be summarized as follows:
Determine the subset of input data based on the input data index (e.g., data [40] belongs to the subset from index 40 to 59).
Calculate the row index as input_data_index / 20 and the column index as input_data_index % 20.
Use the column index to determine the corresponding linear weight subset (e.g., column index 0 corresponds to linear weights from index 0 to 19).
Multiply and accumulate the input data subset with the corresponding linear weight subset to produce the output data.
I hope this example demonstrates my understanding of the calculation logic. Please let me know if there's anything else I can clarify or assist with!

Perfect! You have done it correctly. Can you give me an example for data [51] so we can make sure you understand?
Certainly! Let me provide the example for data [51] based on the calculation logic.
Example 7: For data [51] in the input, data 40 to 59 from the input should multiply and accumulate with data 220 to 239 from the linear weight. This action produces the output data [51].
In this example, data [51] belongs to the subset of input data from index 40 to 59. The row index of data [51] is 2 (51 / 20 = 2), and the column index is 11 (51 % 20 = 11).
Since the column index is 11, the corresponding linear weights for data [51] are from index 220 to 239. The starting index of the linear weights is calculated as column_index * 20 = 11 * 20 = 220.
The calculation logic can be summarized as follows:
Determine the subset of input data based on the input data index (e.g., data [51] belongs to the subset from index 40 to 59).
Calculate the row index as input_data_index / 20 and the column index as input_data_index % 20.
Use the column index to determine the corresponding linear weight subset (e.g., column index 11 corresponds to linear weights from index 220 to 239).

The main changes in this updated code are:
In the MULTIPLY state, the wbs_adr_i signal is modified to use input_addr[4:0] as the column index and 5'b00000 as the base address for each subset of linear weights.
In the output logic, the wbs_adr_i signal is updated to use input_addr[4:0] as the column index and input_counter as the offset within the subset of linear weights.
With these modifications, the linear.v module should now calculate the output data based on the provided calculation logic. Each output data point is produced by multiplying and accumulating the corresponding subset of input data with the corresponding subset of linear weights determined by the column index.
Please note that you also need to ensure that the SRAM initialization file (weights_init_0.mem) contains the correct linear weights in the appropriate order.

Can you explain what you have currently in the calculation logic please? i just checked the output, after every 13 output there are 19 null output. I think you did something wrong with implementing what we discussed about calculation logic earlier.
Apologies for the confusion. Let me explain the current calculation logic in the code and identify the issue.
In the current code, the calculation logic is as follows:
The input data is divided into subsets of 20 elements each, based on the row index (input_addr / 20).
The column index is determined by input_addr[4:0], which represents the position within each subset of input data.
In the MULTIPLY state, the linear weight is read from the SRAM using the address wbs_adr_i, which is formed by concatenating the column index (input_addr[4:0]) and the input_counter as the offset.
The input data is multiplied with the corresponding linear weight, and the result is stored in mult_result.
In the ACCUMULATE state, the multiplication result is truncated to 1.7.24 format and accumulated with the previous accumulation result (acc_result).
After processing 20 elements (input_counter reaches 19), the accumulated result is stored as the output data, and the output_valid signal is set to indicate a valid output.
The issue with the current logic is that it does not correctly handle the column index and the corresponding linear weights. The linear weights are not being accessed in the correct order based on the column index.
To fix this, we need to modify the calculation logic as follows:
Calculate the starting address of the linear weights based on the column index (input_addr % 20) multiplied by 20.
In the MULTIPLY state, update wbs_adr_i to use the starting address of the linear weights plus the input_counter as the offset.
Here's the corrected code for the MULTIPLY state:
verilog

Copy code
MULTIPLY: begin
  // Calculate the starting address of the linear weights
  wbs_adr_i <= {22'h000000, input_addr[4:0] * 5'd20};
  
  // Read linear weight from SRAM
  wbs_stb_i <= 1'b1;
  wbs_cyc_i <= 1'b1;
  wbs_we_i <= 1'b0;
  wbs_sel_i <= 4'b1111;
  
  // Wait for SRAM read acknowledgment
  if (wbs_ack_o) begin
    mult_result <= $signed(input_data) * $signed(wbs_dat_o);
    $display("Debug: MULTIPLY - Input data: %d, Weight: %d, Multiplication result: %d", input_data, wbs_dat_o, mult_result);
    wbs_stb_i <= 1'b0;
    wbs_cyc_i <= 1'b0;
    next_state = ACCUMULATE;
  end else begin
    $display("Debug: MULTIPLY - Waiting for SRAM read acknowledgment");
    next_state = MULTIPLY;
  end
end
In this updated code, wbs_adr_i is calculated by multiplying the column index (input_addr[4:0]) by 20 to get the starting address of the linear weights. The input_counter is then added as an offset to access the correct linear weight within the subset.
I apologize for the confusion earlier. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
